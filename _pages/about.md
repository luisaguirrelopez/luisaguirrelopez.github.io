I am an ecologist and biogeographer from Oviedo, Asturias. I'm interested in learning how complex biological systems work in order to apply this knowledge to the conservation of biodiversity.  
My undergraduate studies were completed at the Faculty of Biology at the University of Oviedo. Following that, I moved to Mexico, where I received an honors Master's degree in Biological Sciences. I am now pursuing a PhD in Geography at Florida State University.
